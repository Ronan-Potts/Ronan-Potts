Hi there,

I'm Ronan Potts, a current student at the University of Sydney. The title of my degree is "Bachelor of Science (Advanced) and Master of Mathematical Sciences", and I'm currently persuing a double major in Mathematics & Physics.

This GitHub page contains the code from all of my projects. Feel free to read through and use any of the code. Please send me an email [[ronanpotts6@gmail.com](mailto:ronanpotts6@gmail.com)] if you have any concerns.
